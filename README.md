[![Readability version](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/readability.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/readability)

Readability is a tool for extracting and curating the primary readable content of a webpage.  
Check out The [Documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/readability/Readability.html) for full and detailed guides

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add readability to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:readability, "~> 0.9"}]
end
```

  2. Ensure readability is started before your application:

```elixir
def application do
  [applications: [:readability]]
end
```

Note: Readability requires Elixir 1.3 or higher.

## Usage

### Examples

#### Just pass a url
```elixir
url = "https://medium.com/@kenmazaika/why-im-betting-on-elixir-7c8f847b58"
summary = Readability.summarize(url)

summary.title
#=> "Why I’m betting on Elixir"

summary.authors
#=> ["Ken Mazaika"]

summary.article_html
#=>
# <div><div><p id=\"3476\"><strong><em>Background: </em></strong><em>I’ve spent...
# ...
# ...button!</em></h3></div></div>

summary.article_text
#=>
# Background: I’ve spent the past 6 years building web applications in Ruby and.....
# ...
# ... value in this article, it would mean a lot to me if you hit the recommend button!
```

#### From raw html

```elixir
### Extract the title.
Readability.title(html)

### Extract authors.
Readability.authors(html)

### Extract the primary content with transformed html.
html
|> Readability.article
|> Readability.readable_html

### Extract only text from the primary content.
html
|> Readability.article
|> Readability.readable_text

### you can extract the primary images with Floki
html
|> Readability.article
|> Floki.find("img")
|> Floki.attribute("src")
```

### Options

If the result is different from your expectations, you can add options to customize it.

#### Example
```elixir
url = "https://medium.com/@kenmazaika/why-im-betting-on-elixir-7c8f847b58"
summary = Readability.summarize(url, [clean_conditionally: false])
```

* min_text_length \\\\ 25
* remove_unlikely_candidates \\\\ true
* weight_classes \\\\ true
* clean_conditionally \\\\ true
* retry_length \\\\ 250

**You can find other algorithm and regex options in `readability.ex`**

## Test

To run the test suite:
