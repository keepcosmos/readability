Readability is a tool for extracting and curating the primary readable content of a webpage.

## Installation

The package can be installed as:

Add `:readability` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:readability, "~> 0.12"}
  ]
end
```

After that, run mix deps.get.

Note: Readability requires Elixir 1.10 or higher.

## Usage

### Examples

#### Just pass a url

```elixir
url = "https://medium.com/@kenmazaika/why-im-betting-on-elixir-7c8f847b58"
summary = Readability.summarize(url)

summary.title
#=> "Why I’m betting on Elixir"

summary.published_at
#=> ~U[2015-02-23 16:53:27.006Z]

summary.authors
#=> ["Ken Mazaika"]

summary.article_html
#=>
# <div><div><p id=\"3476\"><strong><em>Background: </em></strong><em>I’ve spent...
# ...
# ...button!</em></h3></div></div>

summary.article_text
#=>
# Background: I’ve spent the past 6 years building web applications in Ruby and.....
# ...
# ... value in this article, it would mean a lot to me if you hit the recommend button!
```

#### From raw html

```elixir
### Extract the title.
Readability.title(html)

### Extract the published at
Readability.published_at(html)

### Extract authors.
Readability.authors(html)

### Extract the primary content with transformed html.
html
|> Readability.article
|> Readability.readable_html

### Extract only text from the primary content.
html
|> Readability.article
|> Readability.readable_text

### you can extract the primary images with Floki
html
|> Readability.article
|> Floki.find("img")
|> Floki.attribute("src")
```

### Options

If the result is different from your expectations, you can add options to customize it.

#### Example

```elixir
url = "https://medium.com/@kenmazaika/why-im-betting-on-elixir-7c8f847b58"
summary = Readability.summarize(url, [clean_conditionally: false])
```

- `:min_text_length` \\\\ 25
- `:remove_unlikely_candidates` \\\\ true
- `:weight_classes` \\\\ true
- `:clean_conditionally` \\\\ true
- `:retry_length` \\\\ 250

**You can find other algorithm and regex options in `readability.ex`**
